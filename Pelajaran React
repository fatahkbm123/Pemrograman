 - Concept of Components & State
   UI are broken up into individual components of which have some sort of state associated with them.
     
   Each component can have it's own data & state of being
   We also have application level state, usually implemented using a state manager like Redux, Vuex, etc
   Nested components (Parent & Children)
   Can be directly or used in a router
   
 - Spread Operator (...)
   State is usually immutable, meaning we can not simply change it, we need to make copy. The spread operator allows us to do that.
   
   const userState = {
    name : 'John'
   };
   
   const newUserstate = {
    ...userState, // name : 'John'
    age : 30   
   }
